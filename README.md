This repository contains a few software engineering samples from various projects that I worked on.
The presented code is by no means complete and serves only for code style/culture
presentation.

### [oidc](oidc)
Fully tested and civilized (i.e. with proper documentation and type annotations)
implementation of an OIDC client that allows for easy implementation of various
OIDC backends (this solution showcases two backends: Fusionauth and Auth0).

### [architecture](architecture)
Software architecture that I designed and implemented for
TailorInvest start-up (company ceased to exist for financial reasons). 
Everything in the diagram was designed and implemented in a span of
roughly 5 months.

### [ansible](ansible)
A sample showcasing initialization and deployment of a HA (HAProxy with
Keepalived with virtual IP address) K8S cluster.

### [matrix.h](matrix.h)
Implementation of a matrix container. Very archaic piece of code :-). Have some
bigger C++ projects (1000s lines of codes) but unfortunately are not very
presentable.
